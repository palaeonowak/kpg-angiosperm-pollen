# Morphological disparity of angiosperm pollen across the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary in North America
Disparity and diversity analyses and visualizations of Maastrichtian and Palaeocene angiosperm pollen in North America. Fossil occurrences were complied from previous publications. Morphological characters for pollen taxa from the Maastrichtian and Palaeocene were encoded based on their descriptions and following the methodology of Lupia (1999; https://doi.org/10.1666/0094-8373(1999)025<0001:DMDATD>2.3.CO;2).

The R code reproduces the analyses and figures in the paper "Changes in morphological disparity of angiosperm pollen across the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary in North America" by H. Nowak, P.E. Jardine, L. Mander, W.T. Fraser, and B.H. Lomax.

This work was funded through NERC grant NE/T000392/1.
